# Installation

Laracube can be installed using [composer](https://getcomposer.org/).

```shell
composer require laracube/laracube
```

Once the package has been installed via composer run `laracube:install` artisan command.

```shell
php artisan laracube:install
```

After running this command, verify that the `App\Providers\LaracubeServiceProvider`
was added to the providers array in your app configuration file.
If it wasn't, you should add it manually.
If your application uses a different namespace you will need to update it accordingly.

## Directory Structure

Once you have installed the package, you would see the package be structured like this:

```text
.
â”‚â”€â”€ app/Laracube
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Collections/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Reports/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Resources/
â”‚â”€â”€ app/Providers/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ LaracubeServiceProvider.php
â”‚â”€â”€ resources/views/vendor/laracube/partials/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ footer.blade.php
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ logo.blade.php
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ navigation.blade.php
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ user.blade.php
â””â”€â”€ public/vendor/laracube/
    â”œâ”€â”€ img/
    â”œâ”€â”€ app.css
    â”œâ”€â”€ app.js
    â”œâ”€â”€ app.js.LICENSE.txt
    â””â”€â”€ mix-manifest.json
```

ðŸ™Œ Wohoo! Basic installation of Laracube is now complete,
head over to the [Authorizing Laracube](/docs/1-x/getting-started-authorizing) to set the authorization and see how to access the platform.
